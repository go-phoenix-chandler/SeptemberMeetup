# Ulam Spiral

I am using a prime number checker defined below go get it

**go get github.com/kloster/ulam/prime**

Normally, without any flags, ulam creates a spiral marking the prime numbers as a **#**

Available flags:
* -start=10 -> start the number sequence at 10
* -level=10 -> build 10 levels of the ulam spiral
* -graph -> graph the prime numbers, rather than a **#**


Note: I am not a mathmatician, so I was able to translate the ulam spiral as a pattern, rather than a mathematical equation.
Note: Because of the limitations of printing to the console, any number greater than 4 characers in length will break the graphical representation of the spiral most likely.

# September Meetup

We have 2 problems that need solving.  Choose 1 or both and if you'd like, and present your solution. 

## Problem 1: 

Ulam Spiral. Extra points for prime identification and visualization. 

## Problem 2:

Create an API with an endpoint that returns a PNG image containing the numeric representation of the number of times that endpoint has been hit.

## Lint of the Month

We will also be introducing a new segment called "Lint of the Month" where we take a sample of code and identify all the bugs and parts that can be improved.  Let us know if you're interested in presenting this segment.
